**Real World Project**

**Employee Recruitment Case Study**

# 1.  Introduction

## 1.1.   Background

The purpose of this case study is to provide a real world application to Software Engineer Trainees, which they can develop by going through all the stages of a Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).

This is to achieve a reduced time to production of Trainees so that they are “project ready” by the time they are put onto projects.

## 1.2.      Overview

Nano Technologies is a software development firm that employs around 1000 people. It has offices in all the 4 regions – East, West, North & South – of India & its Head office is located in Mumbai. All the top managers sit in the Mumbai office. Their subordinates are placed across all the regions. The geographic difference creates a few hurdles in some of the processes of the company; Appraisal is one such process. This case study is to develop an online appraisal system so that the entire appraisal process happens in an efficient manner.

Apart from developing the application, Trainees are also expected to analyze the requirements and apply OOAD principles to come up with a proper design. Trainees are expected to follow Company coding standards and adhere to best practices and coding principles. Trainees will also have to deploy their application so that it can be tested. For this purpose, they will have to create an installation pack, which will deploy their application, with minimal manual intervention.

  

Apart from the core functionality, the Trainee must also take into consideration important issues like security, ease of use, familiar look-and-feel across the application, easy navigation and performance.

# 1.           Requirements

## 1.1.      Description

# 

Currently the entire appraisal process is carried out manually. A file gets created for each & every employee once he/she joins the company. This file is sent to the manager by HR when the appraisal is due. During the entire appraisal process the file moves between the manager, employee & HR. This is where the problem begins. During the process there is no way to track where the file is lying i.e. whether it is with the manager or the subordinate. There is also no way to find out about the total delay in the entire process. This file contains personal information of the employee, his/her reporting structure, cost-to-company (CTC) etc.

On the eve of the appraisal of an employee, this file is sent to his/her Manager by the HR. The manager fills his/her comments & sends the file back to HR. HR then sends it to the employee, the employee fills in his/her inputs & sends it back to HR. The file is sent back to the manager for a final assessment & approval. Once the manager completes the final assessment the appraisal process is said to be complete.

## 1.2.      The Proposed System

# 

The main objective of the proposed system is to automate the entire appraisal process & remove all the bottlenecks of the existing manual system. Every stakeholder will have his/her own section. There will be 3 sections:

·      HR section

·      Manager (Appraiser) section

·     Employee (Appraisee) section

## 1.3.      User Login

# 

Every stakeholder will have to logon to the system to use it. All the relevant options will be shown to the user depending on the login.

# 2.      HR Section

# 

HR Section will be displayed to the HR user after he/she logs on to the system.. This section will contain following links/pages:

## 2.1.      Employee Information

# 

‘Employee Information’ link will open a paethat allows the user to enter all the information of an employee. All the details of an employee will be entered on the first day of joining. Following details will be entered:
